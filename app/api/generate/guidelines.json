  "guidelines": {
    "design_principles": [
      "Follow minimalistic design — rely on whitespace, typography, and subtle accents instead of heavy decoration.",
      "Each component should be unique but remain visually cohesive with a minimal style.",
      "Use a consistent spacing scale (e.g., 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px).",
      "Apply a consistent border-radius scale (small, medium, large, extra large).",
      "Use subtle shadows and borders for depth — avoid harsh or oversized shadows.",
      "Typography hierarchy should use 2–3 font sizes max per component."
    ],
    "html_rules": [
      "Use semantic HTML (button, nav, section, article, header, footer).",
      "Keep markup clean and shallow — avoid deeply nested containers.",
      "Ensure accessibility with proper aria labels, alt attributes, and roles."
    ],
    "css_rules": [
      "Use a consistent color system: one primary color, one accent, neutrals (gray scale), and background.",
      "Prefer modern layout methods (Flexbox, CSS Grid) over floats.",
      "Spacing should follow a fixed scale rather than arbitrary pixel values.",
      "Use consistent font sizing scale: small, base, large, extra large.",
      "Use a limited shadow scale: subtle, medium, strong — default to subtle.",
      "Use a consistent border-radius scale: small (2–4px), medium (6–8px), large (12–16px), extra large (24px+).",
      "Avoid inline styles; keep CSS modular and scoped per component.",
      "Use relative units (rem, em, %) for responsive sizing."
    ],
    "javascript_rules": [
      "Write plain JavaScript unless otherwise specified.",
      "Keep interactivity minimal — only add logic for toggles, dropdowns, modals, or form validation.",
      "Ensure accessibility (e.g., keyboard navigation, focus states).",
      "Favor declarative, readable code with clear variable and function names."
    ],
    "variation_guidelines": [
      "Do not reuse the same layout — vary structure (horizontal, vertical, grid-based, stacked).",
      "Experiment with different minimal UI archetypes: cards, navigation bars, forms, accordions, modals, tooltips, tabs.",
      "Vary use of spacing and typography scale to create uniqueness.",
      "Use different levels of depth (flat vs. slightly elevated).",
      "Ensure all components are self-contained and reusable."
    ],
    "responsiveness": [
      "All components must be mobile-first and adapt gracefully to larger screens.",
      "On mobile, use stacked layouts; on desktop, use grid or side-by-side layouts.",
      "Text should remain readable across all screen sizes (minimum 14px).",
      "Interactive elements should remain accessible and finger-friendly on mobile."
    ],
    "output_format": [
      "Output should include HTML, CSS, and optional JavaScript in a clean structure.",
      "Separate HTML, CSS, and JS sections clearly with comments.",
      "No external dependencies unless explicitly requested."
